	Welcome to WhatsWrongWithPresentations.com. 
	<br/>We're here to kill bad presentations.
</h1>

<p>
We've gone through life seeing teachers teach, watching salesmen sell, watching ceo's...well ceo and we've come to one conclusion:
There's is a fundamental problem with the way people think about presenting. The unfortunate reality is that the majority of the
world just doesn't know how to present.

<p>
	The mission of this site is to change that.
